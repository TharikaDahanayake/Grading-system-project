# Grading-system-project

## Everyday is a learning day!

This activity involves creating a simple Python program that prompts the user to enter their marks (between 0 and 100), validates the input, and assigns a grade based on predefined criteria. The program demonstrates basic user input handling, input validation (including non-numeric input), and conditional logic to determine and display the appropriate grade.

The technologies used:

- Python
- Text Editor - VS Code or any editor of your choice

#### Thank You & Good Luck!
